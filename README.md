## About the Course

CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies such as game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several key topics:

1. **Search**
2. **Knowledge**
3. **Uncertainty**
4. **Optimization**
5. **Learning**
6. **Neural Networks**
7. **Language**
8. **Conclusion**

Here are some of the key projects:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent.
- **Minesweeper**: Creation of an AI agent that can play Minesweeper.
- **Degrees**: Finding the shortest path between actors using the Kevin Bacon game concept.
- **Nim**: Designing an AI to play the game Nim using reinforcement learning.

## Usage

To run the projects, you will need Python 3 and the following dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each project can be executed independently by navigating to the project directory and running the main script. For example:

```
cd projects/tic-tac-toe
python runner.py
```
